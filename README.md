### Question
Careful planning of the structure of the HTML can assist with identifying selectors in both CSS and Javascript.  How do you think the structure of the ttt files so far do or do not help with that goal?

Knowing where text should go or is anticated of going is helpful when laying it out with html first so it is clear when ids and classes should be called upon for additional functionality and style. The careful structure and breaking down of the assignment is helpful as I start tackling different components and being able to trouble shoot when something doesn't function as intended and I am able to inspect the code and have a reference of where I should be looking in the code to identify mishaps.
